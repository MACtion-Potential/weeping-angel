HC-05 Bluetooth Module is very common
	- https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/electropeak/getting-started-with-hc-05-bluetooth-module-arduino-e0ca81 
	- Bluetooth module which uses serial communications
	- Working voltage: 3.6V-5V
	- Has an internal antenna
	- Automatic connection to the last device
	- HC05 has an internal 3.3V regulator so you can't connect to 5V Voltage
	- To communicate with HC05 using bluetooth - you need bluetooth terminal application
	- Can work with raspberry Pi https://dev.to/ivanmoreno/how-to-connect-raspberry-pi-with-hc-05-bluetooth-module-arduino-programm-3h7a 
	- Amazon $17
	- Seems to be the one that is cheap, easy to use and used with many different bluetooth controlled robots
	- https://www.intorobotics.com/pick-right-bluetooth-module-diy-arduino-project/
	- Many tutorials for this (great for beginners)
	- Covers 30ft of signals and can work as both master or slave

HC-06 Bluetooth Module:
	- 3.3V - 6V
	- Operating Frequency Range: 2.402GHz - 2.480GHz
	- Seems like it can work with Raspberry Pi
	- Specifically the RS232 can be used as a slave 
	- Typically hooked up to 5V pin of Arduino
	- HC-06 is a slave module, cannot connect to ther devices on its own, you need a master module, but could work in tandem with the HC-05

BLE Link Bee
	- Very powerful, both master and slave 
	- 60 meters free space
	- Serial to Bluetooth 4.0 module
	- Supports both 5V and 3.3V MCU's
	- Affordable
	- Supports android and IOS applications (if needed)
	- 'suitable for applications like wearable device', BLE achieves rapid real time communication
	- It can be used with raspberry pi, just need to configure it
	- Can be updated through USB and debugged through a BLUNO AT command

BLE Mini
	- Controllable with IOS
	- Range of 50 m
	- Compatible with Arduino and raspberry Pi
- similar functionality to Link Bee but smaller

BlueSMiRF
	- Had a transceiver on it: can send and recieve data up to 328ft
	- Compatible with devices that support SPP

JY-MCU:
: connect devices and robots that generate massive amounts of data
0 covers 30ft between master and slave devices


RN-42 Shield Bluetooth
	- This is for anything that can be used for arduinos
	- Slightly more expensive but can fit right on top of the arduino board and can work within 65 feet
